# Sorting-Visualizer
This program will use OpenGL to visualize sorting algorithms
The main source for reference is learnopengl.com.

Main priorities are to get the visualizer up and running first.
Then implementation of algorithms will be implemented (Bubble, Quick, etc).
The more tweaks and information variables will be presented.

As of 2018-10-23, a method to generate and ranomize an array has been created.
