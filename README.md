# Sorting-Visualizer
This program will use OpenGL to visualize sorting algorithms
The main source for reference will be learnopengl.com

Main priorities are to get the visualizer up and running first
Then implementation of algorithms will be implemented (Bubble, Quick, etc)
The more tweaks and information variables will be presented
